# React Test: Sorting Articles  

Create a basic article sorting application. For UI, you can use either grid style to showcase articles or list tiles. Design wise itâ€™s up to you, we wanna see how creative you can be.


The app must have the following functionalities:

- Must be developed using Create React App.
- The list of articles to display.
- Each article has the following three properties:
  - title: The title of the article
  - upvotes: The number of upvotes for an article
  - date: The publish date for the article in the format YYYY-MM-DD
- By default, the articles should be displayed as ordered by the number of upvotes in descending order.
- Clicking on the "Most Upvoted" button should reorder and display the articles by the number of upvotes in descending order.
- Clicking on the "Most Recent" button should reorder and display the articles by date in descending order.
- You can assume that each article has a unique publish date and number of upvotes.

## Note: 
You do not need to create a server for this, just create a data.json file and put dummy data to use in that file.

# Unit Tests:

It would be really nice if we can see some unit tests around the components you create.

# Send us Github Repo Link:

Send us the create the repoistory of your solution and send us the github link at farhan@strategisthub.com, please keep in mind that repo must have description to how to run the application and what sort of libraries (if any) have been used.
